- 👋 Hi, I’m @snowka
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, XPATH, XQUERY, and XSLT, all part of my work in the Digital Humanities. I'm also interested in experimenting with single-board computers, like the Raspberry Pi. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning XQUERY and XSLT transformations for Digital Humanities applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Digital Humanities projects and projects that require documentation to be created.
- 📫 How to reach me: snowka@salemstate.edu
